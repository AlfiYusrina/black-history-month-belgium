The theme for this year is: “Black Art: resistance and liberation”. We want to show that black art, like black people, is not a monolith, but is divers, expressive and offers resistance to simple categorisation. We also want to stress that black art exists everywhere and is not restricted to the walls of museums but can also be found in the streets, on blogs and other digital platforms and on the canvases of our bodies. Just like the movements with which it goes, black art is powerful, personal and feels more present than ever. It challenges black activists and artists to do the hard work to interrogate and change the subtle prejudices, deep beliefs and core values ​​that shape our world - in order to feel free.
