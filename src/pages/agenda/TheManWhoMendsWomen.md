Doctor Denis Mukwege is internationally known as the man who treated thousands of women who were raped during the 20-year conflicts in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Despite the rich subsurface, Congo remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Mukwege's endless struggle to end the atrocities and his condemnation of the inviolability enjoyed by the perpetrators was not welcome. At the end of 2012, the doctor was the target of a murder attempt, which he miraculously survived. Because of the death threats, the doctor now lives in isolation at his hospital in Bukavu, under the protection of the United Nations. But Mukwege is no longer alone in his struggle. The women for whom he fights are standing next to him, yearning for justice, the true peace activists.


The film is introduced by Jessica and Magalie Debacker (Twins for Mukwege)
