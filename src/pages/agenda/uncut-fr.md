[Attend this event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/164635451631569/)

You write, you rhyme,
But you have never been on a stage
And you feel that you want to bring something out?
Uncut is the place where you can make your voice heard!
The ice is broken with a few invited artists who introduce the theme of the evening. Afterwards the mic is open for you. Bring what you feel yourself! You don't have to stick to the theme.
Uncut stands for mutual respect. We share art and stories in an open minded atmosphere.

Address: Openbaar Entrepot voor de Kunsten (OPEK)
Vaartkom 4, 3000 Leuven, Belgium
