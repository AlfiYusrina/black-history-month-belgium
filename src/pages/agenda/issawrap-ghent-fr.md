[Attend this event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/2955298627825429/)


This evening is the perfect opportunity to look back on all the experiences we shared last month. What you can certainly expect is great food, great friends and lots of laughter.
By the way, we encourage everyone to bring as much food and drinks as they want! Also take into account vegetarians and those who eat halal.

Until then, ASCOM, AYO, Karibu and Umoja
