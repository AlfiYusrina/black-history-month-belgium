For this project, BHM is working together with FOMU - Fotomuseum Antwerp. FOMU assists the young artists with the substantive development of their project.
From January to February 2021, four students were immersed in the basics of photography and learned how to use photography and family photos to represent their own stories and experiences. Inspired by their own family photos and an intergenerational dialogue with a family member, they created new photos that can be viewed in the public space in Antwerp during Black History Month. With images captured in different environments and contexts, DIVING IN offers a personalized approach to community, identity and history.
