Rwanda en Zo Veel Meer (RZM) is an organisation that has been advocating for adopted Rwandans for years. During this Table Talk, they engage in conversation with other adoptees whose history partly depends on proper archiving. The search for their biological parents is often very expensive: think of airline tickets, compensation for local seekers, getting papers to the surface, legal proceedings, etc.

What if your own history was never recorded, no adoption documents, no birth certificate, you were renamed? Who are you and who can tell you? This is all discussed during this Table Talk.
