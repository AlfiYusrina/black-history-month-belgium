  On March 30th, Black History Month Brussels, in collaboration with CIVA, the
  architecture museum, organize a talk on the decolonization of architecture and
  urban planning, as a way to rethink our city. For this talk, CIVA opened the
  doors of their archives to Black History Month to look for and examine the
  link between the colonization of the Congo and the establishment of Brussels
  as a European capital.
