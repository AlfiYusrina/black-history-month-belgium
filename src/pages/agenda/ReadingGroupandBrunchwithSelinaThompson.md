description: >-
  The day after the final performance of Selina Thompson - salt. (performance) at Beursschouwburg, Selina will have a Reading Group around brunch in a safer space, only accessible to Black people, around the themes of her work. This reading group is important because salt had so much reading woven into how it was made, so Selina wants to share that with folks.
