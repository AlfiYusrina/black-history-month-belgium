  Whether you are used to coming to Rainbow Nation Brussels‚Äô Speaking and Support groups or this is your first time, you are very heartfully welcome. After organizing Speaking and Support groups for QT*IBPOC (LGBTQI+ People who are Black or of Colour) for more than a year and a half, we have decided, starting from this Black History Month Belgium, to ALSO organizing speaking groups strictly for Black LGBTQI+ People in Brussels.
