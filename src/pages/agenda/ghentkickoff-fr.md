10 AM: Expo
2:00 PM â€” 4:00 PM Panel discussion
During this conversation we examine what it means to be "Black" in Belgium. We focus on how this concept has an impact on the identity of Afro-Belgians, how this might differ from the concept
"Black People" that is common in the United States of America, and what future challenges might be for the "Black" community in Belgium.

Moderator of this conversation is: Dr. Ama Kissi. During this conversation, the audience will have the opportunity to ask questions and share experiences.
Address: KapOw
huidevetterken 24, 9000 Gent, Belgium
