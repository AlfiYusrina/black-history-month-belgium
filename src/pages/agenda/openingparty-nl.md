Sunday – Duration : 19:30 - 00:00

Come and join us for the celebration of the official opening of Black History Month Belgium. Celebrating ourselves is a political act and important to release our pain. Learn more about the organisation of Black History Month Belgium, this year’s theme and program. Vibe with others in a safe and proud space and take a moment to interact with performance art that inspires us to heal, that nourishes our souls, and glorifies Blackness in its entirety. Be there for the launch of a month that will shed light on the roots of our health and our capacity as a community to rise up through adversities while embracing our authentic selves.
There will be cool drinks, life performances and good music to set the mood for the night.
Dress code: dress like you love yourself.

Address: Beursschouwburg, Auguste Ortsstraat 20 -28, 1000 Brussels, Belgium [see at maps](https://goo.gl/maps/DhBu8cak4gTzckgZA)
