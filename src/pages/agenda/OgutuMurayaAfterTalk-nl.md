description: >-
  Black History Month Belgium is the perfect frame to look at the different experiences of Black Bodies within predominantly white environments in Western Europe. Kenyan writer and theater-maker Ogutu Muraya refers to the he spent in Amsterdam after leaving Nairobi for his Master’s studies as “beautiful, complex and painful – an amalgam of paradoxical experiences”. Ogutu will confront these experiences he lived as a young African adult in Western Europe to the lived experiences of two Brussels-based Black Afropean men who were have been in Western Europe since a younger age, and in the very particular setting of the country which colonized their country of birth : his collaborator, Curaçao-born Afro-Dutch activist and artist Quinsy Gario, and the talk's moderator, Rwandan-born Afro-Belgian Eric Cyuzuzo.

Bios:
Ogutu Muraya is a writer and theatre-maker whose work is embedded in the practice of orature. He studied International Relations at USIU-Africa and graduated in 2016 with a Master in Arts at DAS Theatre in Amsterdam. His performative works and storytelling have featured in theatres and festivals across different countries. On Thin Ice marks a return of Ogutu’s work to Beursschouwburg, the artist having previously presented here in 2017 (Because I always feel like running) and in 2018 (Fractured Memories).

Quinsy Gario is an activist as well as a visual and performance artist from the Dutch Caribbean. His most well-known work, Zwarte Piet Is Racisme (2011–2012), critiqued the general knowledge surrounding the racist Dutch figure Zwarte Piet (Black Pete). Quinsy has an academic background in Gender Studies and Postcolonial Studies and is a graduate of the Master Artistic Research programme at The Hague’s Royal Academy of Art.

Eric Cyuzuzo is a thinker, a fighter, an interrogator in a perpetual learning process. His creativity expresses itself through imagining, building and organizing platforms that are going to showcase and elevate the narratives of Black people at the intersection of their multiple identities. He believes in a dual approach : he has founded and works within grassroots organizations, and also currently works for several cultural organizations in Brussels.
