We're going to talk about her.
We're going to talk about you and me and everyone.
We want to talk about hair that is: braided, combed, styled, pressed, hurt, straightened, feared, unrestrained, suppressed, liberated, washed, casual. We are all our own hair.

The new theater duo Blackman & Blokland explain the terms "good hair" and "bad hair". Everyone struggles with hair and some people have a special history with their hair. A cheerful and serious show with spoken word, stand up, singing and theater combined with a good dose of humor.

This performance is in Black History Month, and has been curated by RataPlanmaker Nyira Hens. Following on from the performance, the players Yahmani Blackman, Dorothy Blokman and host Nyira Hens invite you for a follow-up discussion.

★★★★ - De Volkskrant:

"... from a simple point of view, the performance grows into a sharp, enthusiastic and relevant discussion piece about cultural appropriation, which luckily also has enough to laugh."



Winner of the Amsterdam Fringe Awards 2018 and nominated for the BNG culture prize 2018.

A unique setting with interactive video projections.

 Ideal for everyone from 12 years old.
