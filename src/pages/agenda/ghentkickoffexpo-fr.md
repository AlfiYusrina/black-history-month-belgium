Doors open at 5pm

Music, slam poetry and artists will be announced on this page.

This year theme for black history month Belgium is “the roots of our wellbeing”. Our activities will be focussing on wellness within our community. Wellness can encompass a lot of different things. Of course you have the difference between mental and psychical wellbeing but your relationship with your family, your body and the outside world are also themes that relate to wellness. Some people can find healing simply in the creating of art. Others might find that painting/drawing/ photographing our community and creating representation is vital to our wellbeing. In this exhibition we invite you to come and discover what this theme means to us (and you). We will showcase the works of various black creatives and hope to create a space that not only inspires you but allows you to meet other people in our community who share your desire to create.

The exhibition will continue the following day (8/03).
Organised by the BHM team Ghent and curated by our team members Emilia Brys  &  Loulou Salumu.
