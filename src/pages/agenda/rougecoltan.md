  Is a feature film that was played at the Africa Film Festival last year. We chose this film for this year's edition of Black History Month in Limburg because it is a powerful short film. The alternative screening of a still very contemporary theme has succeeded in this film.

A short description:

Abo Ikoyo is a Belgian-Congolese girl of 17 years. When she delves into the colonial past of Congo for a school assignment, she also discovers a lot about her own family history: the resistance of her ancestors to colonial rule, a great-grandfather who was the driver of Patrice Lumumba, the devastating war for coltan and others blood minerals.

The film is French spoken and subtitled in Dutch.

On this evening you are welcome from 7.30 pm where you will be welcomed at Maison Florida in a cozy living room setting with African snacks. The film will be played from 8.30 pm, followed by a sofa-talk with a discussion about the film.

It promises to be a very pleasant and enriching evening. We would like to welcome you and your friends.
