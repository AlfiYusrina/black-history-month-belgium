title: A conversation about colonial statues and street names
slug: colonialstatues
date: 2021-02-15T16:35:39.507Z
description: Do we hear the different voices in the debate over disputed statues and street names? Do we listen unbiased to reactions and protests about charged images and street names? How do opinions today differ from the periods when many statues were erected? How do people today experience the presence of this heritage in public space? And above all, how do we give these different voices a place in the processes that are being started?
