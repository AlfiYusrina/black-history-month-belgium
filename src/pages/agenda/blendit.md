RZM is a young organization of adopted people who is building a network of experiential experts to share stories, to connect and to reinforce each other.
Our goal is to invite people to view adoption from the point of view of the adopted person.

Blend-iD takes you through portraits and images and shows you what it's like to grow up as a Rwandan child in a white environment

ðŸ“¸Photographers: Trudy Kazangu, Sulaiman Jaffa and  Stedelijke Academie Turnhout.
