Envisioned as a creative forum for those who are interested in telling stories, in this workshop participants will be writing, exchanging, performing, and learning from one another. I Been Tellin Tales I Almost Understand is a space for writers who would write all day if they could, while also being a space for writers who do not yet know that they are writers, but have their suspicions and curiosities. As a community we will encourage, nurture, and hold space for diverse Black perspectives and experience. In addition to developing narratives weâ€™ll also discuss creative ways to construct and share our stories. Please register for this workshop by submitting the following: an image or a description of an image that you feel connected to, or an image that you find fascinating, the titles of the last three songs that gave you life, and a short text which describes one of your earliest memories. This event is open to all people of Black African descent and is a safer space Black womxn, Black people who are disability identified, Black people who chart their identities along LGBTQIA PLUS spectrums, Black people in administrative irregularity, Black who identify as working class, and Black people who practice African Traditional Religions and / or Afro-Diasporic Religions.
