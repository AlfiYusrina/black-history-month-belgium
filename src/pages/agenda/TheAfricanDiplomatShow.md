Expect African Diplomat's collaborators, friends and former guest DJs on his show SHUNGU, Mambele, Rokia Bamba, DTM Funk, M I M I and Amari, to take over the decks, as well as some live music and striking visuals.

The artist Cédric Kouamé, better known under his DJ alias African Diplomat, is now the host of a one-hour late-night radio show on BRUZZ every other Wednesday evening from 22:00 to 23:00. The African Diplomat Show is a platform dedicated to experimentation and dialogue. It aims to highlight and network Belgium’s contemporary artists of African descent, and to create exchanges in connection with their artistic practices, all in a musical atmosphere that covers a spectrum from the 70/80s to today.
