This evening will be all about learning about how to best care for and heal our bodies, skin and hair, through the teachings of Black individuals who have successfully made it the focus of their personal business venture.

They will talk about the ingredients that are important for their products, specifically for Black People, keeping in mind the diversity of our hair, skin and body types. They will also take us through the evolution of their own body-, hair- and skincare routines, while growing up Black in different context.

They will each have some of their products with them to sell to the attendees.
