slug: fatphobia
date: 2020-02-05T21:50:27.946Z
description: >-
  There used to be a time that fat bodies were celebrated in art, newspapers, magazines and medical journals, but all that changed in the 18th century, when fatness got associated with the idea that people with coloured skin were racially inferior savages. During this event, which is part of the Black History Month Belgium program, you will learn and experience how that shift continues to haunt black bodies till this day. With Sabrina Strings (author of fearing the black body), Lisette Ma Neza (Slam Poetry Champion), Brunette Matinda (Afroyoga), Heleen Debeuckelaere (Writer) and Rachael Moore (coördinator RainbowHouse)
