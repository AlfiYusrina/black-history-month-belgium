Irreversible Entanglements (concert) BSB ⚭ AB
Irreversible Entanglements are a liberation-oriented free jazz collective formed in early 2015 by poet Camae Ayewa (a.k.a. Moor Mother), saxophonist Keir Neuringer, and bassist Luke Stewart, who came together to perform at a Musicians Against Police Brutality event organised after the slaying of Akai Gurley by the NYPD.

Months later the group added trumpeter Aquiles Navarro and drummer Tcheser Holmes for a single day of recording at Seizures Palace Recording in Brooklyn, and the full quintet’s first time playing together was captured for their startling self titled debut.

In four relentless bouts of inspired fire music the instrumentalists explore and elaborate compositional ideas drawn from their deep individual studies of free jazz improvisation, but the tone of each piece is driven decisively by Ayewa’s searing poetic narrations of Black trauma, survival and power. The message is the undeniable essence of the music.
