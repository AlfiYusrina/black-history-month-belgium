These short sentences describe Rafiki. Sentences that make us look forward to what will happen in the movie, that make us ask ourselves what will be. In this movie, Samantha Mugatsia and Sheila Munyiva star as Kena and Ziki respectively. Two young women who fall in love and start a relationship. However, in Kenya, same-sex relationships are not only forbidden, but illegal as well. And to make matters worse, the fathers of Kena and Ziki are both candidates in the upcoming local elections. So when their relationship becomes public, things take a very dark turn for all involved.
Until then!
