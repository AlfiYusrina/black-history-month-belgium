MC Yallah hails from Kenya, lives and works in Kampala, Uganda, and is signed with the brand-new label Hakuna Kulala, a sub-label of the renowned Nyege Nyege Tapes – organisers of the Nyege Nyege Festival, which takes place a stone’s throw from the source of the Nile. MC Yallah recorded her debut record at Nyege Nyege’s Boutiq Studio together with the French producer Debmaster, renowned for his crazy beats.

The combo of Debmaster’s beats and MC Yallah’s baaanging vocals – a mix of Luganda and Swahili – results in sonic fireworks: Resident Advisor called the duo’s intense live performance at Unsound in Poland "one of the five most important performances of the year". Now they’re touring Europe and will soon be bringing their brand of powerful, futuristic rap to our rooftop. Prepare for fire!
