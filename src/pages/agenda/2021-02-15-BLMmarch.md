The BLM support marches and uprisings in the Netherlands and Belgium this past June 2020 were organized and/or pushed by a lot of Black People who are Women and/or Queer. Historically, these same branches of Black communities got the political movement for Black Liberation ahead by putting their energy and livelihood on the line to then be pushed aside when it comes to demanding real political change for the other identities that intersect with their Blackness. How can the aftermath of the uprisings be used to push for a more intersectional common movement? How can the movement truly be contextualized in Belgium and The Netherlands?
The talk will be moderated by Rainbow Nation Brussels’ co-founders Eric Cyuzuzo & Rachael Moore.

Panelists:
- Ange Amina Nahimana (one of the original BLM5 – all Women and Girls – in BE)
- Naomie Pieter (one of the leaders of the support marches in the NL + co-founder and leader of Black Queer & Trans Resistance NL and Black Pride NL)
- Eric Cyuzuzo (co-founder and leader of Rainbow Nation Brussels + stepped in to help save the support march in Brussels)

Moderated by Rachael Moore (co-founder and leader of Rainbow Nation Brussels)
