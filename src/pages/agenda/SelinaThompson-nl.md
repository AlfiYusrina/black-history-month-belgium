In February 2016, two artists got on a cargo ship, and retraced one of the routes of the Transatlantic Slave Triangle – from the UK via Belgium to Ghana to Jamaica, and back. Their memories, their questions and their grief took them along the bottom of the Atlantic and through the figurative realm of an imaginary past. It was a long journey backwards, in order to go forwards. This show is what they brought back.

salt. is a solo about sorrow, ancestry, home, forgetting and colonialism. It's about the existence of colonial history in the everyday, the politics of grief and what happens inside Selina's head every time someone asks “where are you from?” and won't take Birmingham or her mum's uterus as an answer. Developed during a three month voyage - and with artist collectives in Accra and Kingston – salt. is part of a wider body of work exploring Black identity, being part of a diaspora and the changing and healing that is still to come.

Selina Thompson is an artist and performer based in Birmingham. Her work is playful, participatory and intimate, focused on the politics of identity, and how this defines our bodies, lives and environments. She makes joyous, highly visual work that seeks to connect to those often marginalised by the arts. Her work has been presented in pubs, cafes, hairdressers, toilets, and sometimes even galleries and theatres, including SPILL Festival of Performance, The National Theatre Studios, The New Birmingham Rep, East Street Arts and the West Yorkshire Playhouse.
