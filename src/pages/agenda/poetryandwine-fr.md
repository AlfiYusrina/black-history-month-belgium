The long awaited month is finally here.... BLACK HISTORY MONTH!
This year Leuven is also participating!
We're starting this month with a Poetry & Wine evening to get us in the mood for Black History Month. So have you written a beautiful poem/ short story that you want to share with everyone or do you have a favorite poet that you feel like the whole world should know and love as much as you do? Come and recite these poems! But you are also free come and just listen, to a booze it up, or dip your toes in what will be the beginning of a great month!

Until then!

Address: Parkstraat 41, 3000 Leuven, BelgiÃ«
