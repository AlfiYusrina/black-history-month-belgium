Hiking gives you mental space and especially helps you to get away from the daily life. We want walking, laughing, telling, listening, and above all creating a sense of togetherness. Everybody in their pace.

We leave by train from Antwerp or other cities. Register [see form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x2h4MzlIAiOO9TUI_txTfGVkU6mAX8z_wH1wAw8-1uM/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0Chpxfu6HN7keeI1OJ379AVow8Iamm2jPzKpdopz4A-Bs9UFITj6dVmfI&edit_requested=true)
