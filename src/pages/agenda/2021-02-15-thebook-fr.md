During Black History Month, 4 residents examine Bib Sophia's collection for gaps, bad buys, inconsistencies and other obstacles. How can a contemporary collection and an all-encompassing archive go hand in hand? The residents view the current collection with a critical eye and make proposals to adjust it. The results of their research are discussed during this zoom meeting.

The residents are:
Awa-Alice Ba
Ange-Vanessa Nsazineza
Lisette Ma Neza
Sachka Samuelle Vincent
