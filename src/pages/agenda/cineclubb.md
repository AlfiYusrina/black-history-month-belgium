Synopsis:
Guided by Vestine, extravagant star of radio nights, the film sets out to discover Rwandan sexuality, in search of the water that gushes from the bodies of women and reveals to us with humor and spontaneity the mystery of female ejaculation.
Are Rwandans the heirs of another way of making love, where female pleasure is central? Beyond the discovery of these sexual practices, it's about words, sharing and transmission.
L'Eau SacrÃ©e paints an intimate portrait of a country and its relationship to its traditions.

After the movie, we chat and get hydrated ðŸ’¦

Address: FATSABBATS, Rue Philippe de Champagne 5, 1000 Bruxelles [See maps](https://goo.gl/maps/fRmRW6RtoArwWefM7)
