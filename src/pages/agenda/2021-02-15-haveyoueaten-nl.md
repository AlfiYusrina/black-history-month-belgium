Featuring Oli Elono and Isaiah Lopaz
In Anthology / Appendix, writer and artist Isaiah Lopaz works with storytelling, narrative, and dialogue as a praxis for archiving an array of Black Queer experiences.
Conceived during then Covid-19 pandemic this series, largely centred around text-based works, imagines publishing as a process that can be carried out across multiple formats
through poetic digital and public happenings.


In Have You Eaten Today? chef Oli Elono and Isaiah Lopaz speak of cuisine as care, as a site of historical archives, and a space of poetic resistance. Beginning with a public discussion via zoom webinar and culminating in a communal but socially distanced dining experience, Oli and Isaiah will invite people who identify as Black and Queer to consider
food as nourishment, the dinner table as a site of activism, and the healing properties contained in food created with passion, purpose, joy, and love. As a gesture toward multisensory archival practice, thirty-five dinners will be made available for Black and Queer people at the artistâ€™s discretion.
