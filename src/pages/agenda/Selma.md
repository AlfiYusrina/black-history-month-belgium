description: >-
  March 1965. Pastor Martin Luther King, who received the Nobel Peace Prize a few months earlier, travels to Selma, Alabama, the starting point for a peaceful march. His goal: to get President Lyndon B. Johnson to legislate to ensure the unconditional right to vote for African-Americans in the southern states. In these states, in fact, while the law gives them the right, the black community still cannot vote.
