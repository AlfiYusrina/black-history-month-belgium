  AYO welcomes you with pleasure at the BHM event "While being Black". This evening we create a safe space where you will have the opportunity to express your heart, to share your experiences, to ask questions, but also to advise your peers about the most daily matters and events that happen to us, the Black community, unfortunately not always evident, hassle-free or problem-free.
