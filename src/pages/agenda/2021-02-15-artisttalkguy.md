Artist Guy Woueté and curator Sorana Munsya enter into discussion about Guy’s creative process and the social topics that their work has in common.
They’ll be talking about the (lack of) knowledge and (mis-)information about (neo-)colonialism, about social justice movements (as also explored in Guy’s current performance work En Quête des Marges Fluctuantes) and the uplift and raise in collective consciousness that such movements have experienced in recent months, and about the art that inspires them both.
 This conversation will be held in French and moderated by Eric Cyuzuzo.

In her curatorial practice and writings, she is concerned with the connections between art and individual as well as collective healing strategies or practices. Specialized in contemporary visual art created by african artists, she was the assistant curator of the 5th Lubumbashi Biennale of Contemporary Art. She writes for many art catalogues and art magazines such as Hart, the 12th Bamako Encounters catalogue etc. She recently curated the first solo exhibition of the congolese artist Leonard Pongo at Bozar, Brussels.
