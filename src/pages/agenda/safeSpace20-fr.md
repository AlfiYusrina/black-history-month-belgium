This workshop introduces participants in understanding the navigation and mental construction of safe spaces in public areas. What are safe spaces and what does it mean to have a safe space? We present techniques and advice for transferring foreign information that an individual may not necessarily think of first hand. The workshop proceeds in three sessions: Introduction to workshop and group dialogues; A group exercise using techniques (such as sensory immersion); A group evaluation of experiences and discussions. The aim is to help participants assess their future design development process.

Workshop is free of charge.
