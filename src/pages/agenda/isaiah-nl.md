'Spheres & Circles, Circles & Spheres' (formerly titled 'Portrait Noir') is an ongoing multilocal, intergenerational, dialogue that centers the perspectives of Black people working in a variety of different fields including art, academia and activism. Themes and subject matter are explored through indigenous and diasporic traditions and practices including but not limited to: ritual, myth, movement, and the usage of Indigenous languages.

Each performance is preceded by a closed conversation which takes place over dinner, with previous discussions leading to a live exploration of topics such as: Black Sisterhood, histories of homosexuality in Africa, mothering Black daughters, decolonising science, Black art, and relationships between cultural appropriation and misogynoir in gay/queer spaces.

Wigbertson Julian Isenia is a PhD candidate working at the University of Amsterdam. His work centers on the concepts of gendered and sexual citizenship beyond their legal conceptualisation in ​Curaçao ​and Bonaire through an analysis of cultural articulations and practices such as archival collections, literature, theater, and cultural performance. He investigates how these cultural practices and articulations grapple with recent developments pertaining to sexual and gender minority rights, tourism, the colonial relationships with the Netherlands, and their historical legacy. He is also co-founder of Black Queer and Trans Resistance and the Black Queer Archives.
