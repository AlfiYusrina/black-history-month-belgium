During the online live shows that will take place every Tuesday in March, we discover together with Zelda Fitzgerald and DJ Skillzington which artists have made the top 40. In addition to the music, the audience will also learn fun stories about the artists, their generation and how some songs came about.

Our guests? That remains a surprise.
