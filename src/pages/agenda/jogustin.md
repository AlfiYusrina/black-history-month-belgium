Bio :
Jo Güstin is a Pan-African writer, humorist, lyricist and screenwriter. The common thread of his creations can be summed up in the triptych "decolonization, intersectionality, liberation". Preventing from going around in circles, she tackles sensitive subjects while making “laugh, dream, think”. After the tragicomic 9 Luminous Stories published in 2017 by Présence Africaine, Jo Güstin closes sixteen years of life in France with Ah Sissi, you have to suffer to be French!, A brilliant novel in the novel, at the crossroads of the essay, autobiography and fiction.

“Being French full-time when you're not white is a demanding challenge: Monday, you have to complain because, anyway, it's Monday; Tuesday, you have to be the favorite personality of the French; on Wednesday, we must dissociate ourselves from Islam; Thursday, you have to win an international tournament; Friday, you have to win a Nobel Prize ... because at the slightest disappointment you are inevitably reminded of where you come from. Sparkling and caustic, Jo Güstin gives us, between story and free essay, a shocking novel in the form of a farewell letter to France written at the tip of a ruthless and corrosive pen. It opens the way to feminist and intersectional African literature of great finesse by telling with the spicy tone that characterizes it moments of life of racialized women in France, interspersed with protrusions in the life of its narrator.
