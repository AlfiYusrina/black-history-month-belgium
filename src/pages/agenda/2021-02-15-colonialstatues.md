title: A conversation about colonial statues and street names
slug: colonialstatues
date: 2021-02-15T16:35:39.507Z
description: Do we hear the different voices in the debate over disputed statues and street names? Do we listen unbiased to reactions and protests about charged images and street names? How do opinions today differ from the periods when many statues were erected? How do people today experience the presence of this heritage in public space? And above all, how do we give these different voices a place in the processes that are being started?

The purpose of this discussion is to bring out a diversity of voices to enrich the different trajectories about images and street names.

The speakers are:

Stephanie Collingwoode Williams (antropologe, activiste)
Omar Ba (historicus, consultant diversiteit en inclusie)
Nyanchama Okemwa (Hand in Hand tegen racisme)
Mathieu Charles (schrijver & performance artiest)

Moderator Sarah Agyemang (africanist) opens the evening with an interview of our speakers about a self-chosen example. Why did they choose this image, this street name? What strikes them and why? What do they think should happen to it? What do they like about the existing routes?

Participation is free. You can register [here](https://faro.be/kalender/horen-we-wel-verschillende-stemmen-een-gespreksavond-over-beladen-koloniale-standbeelden)
