March is all about Black History Month. In collaboration with Black History Month Belgium from OSU vzw, we fill the month with lectures, workshops and tours. Black History Month has its origins in the United States and is now ready for its third Belgian edition. An annual celebration of the resilience of the black community in the present and the past.
