17-year-old Ada from Dakar falls in love with Souleiman, but is married off to another man. When Souleiman suddenly disappears, it seems that he is trying to take the risky boat trip to Europe with his friends. If the bodies of some of those friends wash ashore on the beach, it is assumed that Souleiman also did not survive the journey. But then Ada's girlfriends are visited by the souls of the dead men, who demand that the injustice done to them is corrected ... What starts as a doomed romance unnoticed turns into a supernatural story in which the spirits of victims raise the injustice in Senegal against the background of the Atlantic ocean.
