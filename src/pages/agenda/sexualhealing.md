[Attend this event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/212462576790330/)

When gathering with other Black people, we're quick to exchange on what oppresses us. It is at the Root of our Health that we have also have safer spaces to focus on what makes us feel good and lift us up. This evening will be all about that.

After introducing the attendees to the houserules, the event will start with content creator (co-founder of the podcast Vocal About It) Sarah Diedro Jordao and panafricanist Doula Adidi Mbole Kasongo having a genuine conversation on what me-time looks like for them, how seeing therapists has helped their sanity, the meaning of Black sisterhood, their journey towards healing intergenerational trauma and towards self-love as Black Womxn, and how that self-love and their love for Black Womxn has powered many of their projects, and has led them to focus on Black Womxn in their various work, etc.

Sarah will then give a quick Black Love Toast before they open the floor for Q&A and conversations with the audience.

This will be a safer space, only accessible to Black People and People of Black African Descent. â€‹Black Womxn and Non-Binary Black People are priority, and will be given priority of questions and interventions, but we want Black men to feel welcome to join and attend this too.

FREE, but registration is mandatory, by email at [bhm@beursschouwburg.be](mailto:bhm@beursschouwburg.be)

Address: Beursschouwburg, Auguste Ortsstraat 20 -28, 1000 Brussels, Belgium
