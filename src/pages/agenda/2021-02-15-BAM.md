In this talk John Leerdam (founder of Black Achievement Month) and Aminata Ndow and Mohamed Barrie (co-founders and National Coordinators of Black History Month Belgium) dive in on the origin and idea behind BAM NL and BHM BE, how both organizations grew, why the months of October and March were chosen respectively, etc.
The theme of BHM BE 2021 is Collecting Our Past and Future: Archiving and Documenting the Past, Future and Present of Black People in Belgium, the key word being “archiving” as this is a first effort towards building a comprehensive Black Archive in Belgium. The Netherlands already happen to have one in the institution that is The Black Archives. In the second part of this talk Mohamed Barrie and Aminata Ndow will go in conversation with Mitchell Esajas of The Black Archives on the birth and history of The Black Archives and the importance of archiving for and about Black Lives in the Low Lands.
