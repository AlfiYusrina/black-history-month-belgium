AKOMFRAHDIO is a performance that takes place in the spacetime continuum and alternative realities. It is a journey through non-linear experience of time, technological innovation, fragments of history and non-Western knowledge production collected in the archives of so-called pasts, presents and futures.

This version was co-produced by Kunstencentrum Vooruit, Production house Rotterdam Theater and Flemish cultural institution the Brakke Grond.

The title is a contraction of John Akomfrah (the artist behind the award-winning "The Last Angel Of History" and founder of Black Audio Film Collective) and the concept of radio frequencies. The premiere of "AKOMFRAHDIO" will be a live-streamed performance, followed by an online aftertalk with the maker, hosted by Black History Month Belgium. The moderator is the guest dramaturge at the Vooruit, Kopano Maroga.
